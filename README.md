## üìù Overview
The Dis-Vector model represents a significant advancement in voice conversion and synthesis by employing disentangled embeddings to precisely capture and transfer speaker characteristics. Its architecture features separate encoders for content, pitch, rhythm, and timbre, enhancing both the accuracy and flexibility of voice cloning.

## üóÉÔ∏è Datasets
For our evaluation, we utilized the following datasets:

| Dataset Name  | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LIMMITS**   | Contains recordings from speakers of various Indian languages (English, Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Bengali) with ~1 hour of speech per speaker. |
| **VCTK**      | Includes recordings from multiple speakers with different accents, providing a rich diversity for evaluation. |

## üìä Evaluation
Quantitative analysis measures the performance of the Dis-Vector model using distance metrics and statistical measures.

### 1. Test Setup
- **Pitch Testing**: Evaluates pitch variations using Pitch Error Rate (PER).
- **Rhythm Testing**: Assesses rhythmic patterns with Rhythm Error Rate (RER).
- **Timbre Testing**: Analyzes vocal qualities using Timbre Error Rate (TER).
- **Content Testing**: Ensures content accuracy using Content Preservation Rate (CPR).
  
### 2. Distance Measurement
- **Cosine Similarity**: Evaluates feature transfer and voice synthesis. 
  \[
  \text{Similarity Score (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Cosine Similarity} + 1}{2} \right) \times 100
  \]

### 3. Ground Truth vs. TTS Output Similarity
- Similarity scores for pitch, rhythm, timbre, and content help measure synthesis accuracy.

## üìà Results
The results of our evaluation showcase the efficacy of the Dis-Vector model compared to traditional models.
