## üõ†Ô∏è Dis-Vector Model Details
The Dis-Vector model consists of several key components that work together to achieve effective voice conversion and synthesis:

- **Architecture**: The model employs a multi-encoder architecture, with dedicated encoders for each feature type:
  - **Content Encoder**: Captures linguistic content and phonetic characteristics.
  - **Pitch Encoder**: Extracts pitch-related features to ensure accurate pitch reproduction.
  - **Rhythm Encoder**: Analyzes rhythmic patterns and timing to preserve the original speech flow.
  - **Timbre Encoder**: Captures unique vocal qualities of the speaker, allowing for more natural-sounding outputs.

- **Disentangled Embeddings**: The model produces a 512-dimensional embedding vector, organized as follows:
  - 256 elements for **content features**
  - 128 elements for **pitch features**
  - 64 elements for **rhythm features**
  - 64 elements for **timbre features**

- **Zero-Shot Capability**: The Dis-Vector model demonstrates remarkable zero-shot performance, enabling voice cloning and conversion across different languages without needing extensive training data for each target voice.

- **Feature Transfer**: The model facilitates the transfer of individual features from the source voice to the target voice, allowing for customizable voice synthesis while retaining the original speech's essence.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance is assessed using various metrics, including Pitch Error Rate (PER), Rhythm Error Rate (RER), Timbre Error Rate (TER), and Content Preservation Rate (CPR), ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the synthesized speech quality.

## üìÇ Database
### LIMMITS Dataset
- Features recordings from speakers of various Indian languages (English, Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Bengali).
- Approximately 1 hour of speech data with around 400 utterances per language.

### VCTK Dataset
- Includes recordings from multiple speakers with different accents and regional variations.
- Utilizes data from 6 male and 2 female speakers, each providing approximately 1 hour of speech.

## üìä Evaluation
Quantitative analysis measures the performance of the Dis-Vector model using distance metrics and statistical measures.

### 1. Test Setup
- **Pitch Testing**: Evaluates pitch variations using Pitch Error Rate (PER).
- **Rhythm Testing**: Assesses rhythmic patterns with Rhythm Error Rate (RER).
- **Timbre Testing**: Analyzes vocal qualities using Timbre Error Rate (TER).
- **Content Testing**: Ensures content accuracy using Content Preservation Rate (CPR).
  
### 2. Distance Measurement
- **Cosine Similarity**: Evaluates feature transfer and voice synthesis. 

### 3. Ground Truth vs. TTS Output Similarity
- Similarity scores for pitch, rhythm, timbre, and content help measure synthesis accuracy.

## üìà Results
The results of our evaluation showcase the efficacy of the Dis-Vector model compared to traditional models.
